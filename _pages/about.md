<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi, my name is Hannah and I am a computer scientist with a focus on machine learning, working with hybrid learning-based and model-based optimization approaches in computer vision. I started studying computer science in 2013 and received my bachelor's degree from the University of Siegen, Germany, as well as my master's degree, which I passed with distinction. I wrote my master's thesis in Los Angeles at UCLA (after participating in a math summer program), for which I received a DAAD scholarship. Recently, I worked on machine learning related topics at the chair of Computer Vision at the University of Siegen and I am currently employed at the Computer graphics chair at the University in Bonn. In general, I like to learn new things and enjoy using my skills in different application areas. Please feel free to contact me per email (drg.hannah(at)gmail.com) if you have any general questions, questions regarding my research topics, or if you just want to talk to me over a cup of coffee!
