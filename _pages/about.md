<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->



Hello! I'm Hannah, a computer scientist specializing in machine learning. My journey began in 2013 at the University of Siegen, Germany, where I earned both my bachelor's and master's degrees, graduating with distinction in the latter. During my master’s studies, I had the opportunity to complete my thesis at UCLA, Los Angeles, thanks to a DAAD scholarship. In 2024, I successfully completed my Ph.D., deepening my expertise and passion for the field.


Currently, I'm happy to be part of the [Computer Graphics team at the University of Bonn](https://cg.cs.uni-bonn.de/), where I am involved in *[InVirtuo 4.0](https://invirtuo.org/)*. Previously, I worked in machine learning at the [Computer Vision chair in Siegen](https://www.vsa.informatik.uni-siegen.de/en/home), exploring the combination of learning-based and model-based methods.

My interests range from computer vision optimization to applying machine learning in various fields. I enjoy the challenge of applying my expertise in different contexts.

If you're curious about my work or have any questions about it, feel free to reach out at drg.hannah(at)gmail.com. I'm also open to casual conversations over coffee!
