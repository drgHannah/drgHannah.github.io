Hello! I'm Hannah, a computer scientist specializing in machine learning. My journey began in 2013 at the University of Siegen, Germany, where I earned both my bachelor's and master's degrees, graduating with distinction in the latter. My master's thesis was completed at UCLA, Los Angeles, supported by a DAAD scholarship.

Currently, I'm excited to be part of the Computer Graphics team at the University of Bonn, where I am involved in *InVirtuo 4.0*. Previously, I worked in machine learning at the Computer Vision chair in Siegen, exploring the combination of learning-based and model-based methods.

My interests range from computer vision optimization to applying machine learning in various fields. I enjoy the challenge of applying my expertise in different contexts.

If you're curious about my work or have any questions about it, feel free to reach out at drg.hannah(at)gmail.com. I'm also open to casual conversations over coffee!

<!-- Hi, my name is Hannah and I am a computer scientist with a focus on machine learning, working with hybrid learning-based and model-based optimization approaches in computer vision. I started studying computer science in 2013 and received my bachelor's degree from the University of Siegen, Germany, as well as my master's degree, which I passed with distinction. I wrote my master's thesis in Los Angeles at UCLA (after participating in a math summer program), for which I received a DAAD scholarship. Recently, I worked on machine learning related topics at the chair of Computer Vision at the University of Siegen and I am currently employed at the Computer graphics chair at the University in Bonn. In general, I like to learn new things and enjoy using my skills in different application areas. Please feel free to contact me per email (drg.hannah(at)gmail.com) if you have any general questions, questions regarding my research topics, or if you just want to talk to me over a cup of coffee!  -->
