I am currently open to supervising Bachelor’s and Master’s theses. Should you be interested, please email me at droege(at)cs.uni-bonn.de. Your email needs to include an introduction about yourself, your study program, your current semester, and your experience with any programming languages.

If you have a specific thesis topic in mind that you would like to work on, please submit a brief proposal of your idea.

**Open Thesis Topics:**


- *Background Matting: A Study on Capture-Stage Datasets and Domain Adaptation*

  Analysis, implementation, and comparison of existing matting algorithms applied to unseen capture stage datasets. Further details can be found **[here](https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/xRpRvvZPVt1sGjW)**. Prior knowledge of Python and Pytorch is recommended.
